# BinaryMatrixConversion

## Full Description
The purpose of the project was to convert a 24bit BMP image to a Binary Matrix, which in essence meant converting the image file to a binary file. The image would first go through a grayscale transformation. Afterwards, image bytes would be read through a stream and converted to a Byte Array. The new Byte Array was converted to a matrix and stored in a .bin file. This had the effect of reducing image size, with the possibility of performing an inverse operation of reconstructing the image.

Basically, insert the image in the Input folder, run the program and check the Output folder.

## Prerequisites
* JVM 
* Java IDE
* A 24BIT BMP image

## How to run
Just import the project using your favourite IDE and run.
